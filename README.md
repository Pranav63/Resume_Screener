# Resume_Screener
This is project gives ur fate a ray of light :P. Just kidding . It has two interface the admin and the user who uploads the resume gets the output whether he is eligible for the post or not .

IT requires an extensive amount of setup first before running . 

1) Fire up ur Mysql - sudo mysql -u root -p 
2) Set up a database "recruit" and make 6 tables inside it . Refer the sqldoc.txt for it . 
3) By default the pass for sql - user - root , password - root .
4) Other make the changes in the JDBCManger.java file . 
5) Fire up the terminal and run "javac recruit/*.java" to compile all files .
